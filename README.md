## You Have Found Me

Hello, my online fake person name is Poetic. I spent 90% of my free time making sick robots to compete in the Vex Robotics Competition. Part of Canyon Robotics Team 15442C. I Design, Build, Document, and Drive said robots. 

## Programming Stuffs

I have absoluetly no useful projects and am not committed to any either. If you got something you can reach me on Discord @Poetic#1843. I know several languages most of which I use for making things to make my life easier, or making stupid things that have little to no purpose.
